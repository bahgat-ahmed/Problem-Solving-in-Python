# Problem-Solving-in-Python
Following Dr. Mostafa Saad's [Algorthmic Interviews Sheet]() for enhancing by problem solving skills. The sheet consists of three levels. I will have a folder for every level inwhich I will insert the problems I solved in that level.

Each file in the folder will be in this format: **problem_name_number.py** where the number is the number of the problem in the current level guided by the problems' orders found in the original sheet.

Moreover, I was practicing in the following Kaggle Notebook(s) to test my answers: (Will be updated with other Notebooks for levels 2 & 3 when I reach them)
