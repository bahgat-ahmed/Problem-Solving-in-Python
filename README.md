# Problem-Solving-in-Python

## Overview

This repository consists of two folders:

1. **Level 1**: In this folder I was following Dr. Mostafa Saad's [Algorithmic Interviews Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ClmoHFMqQKOHinRhrId42sbofQ0T0IyaFzZcEcVvXbU/edit#gid=1160016643) for enhancing by problem solving skills. The sheet consists of three levels. In this folder I have put my solution(s) to some of the problems in Level 1 of the sheet in the same order they appeared in the sheet.
2. **AlgoExpert**: In this folder, I will put my solution(s) to the [AlgoExpert](https://www.algoexpert.io/product)'s problems. [AlgoExpert](https://www.algoexpert.io/product) is a product that I purchased which provides specific problems along with their solutions that should help you reach a high-level of problem solving that will make you qualified to solve the big companies interview questions.

## Organization

Each file in each folder will be in this format: **problem_name_number1_number2.py**:
1. `problem_name` is the problem name
2. `number1` is the number of the problem in the current folder guided by the problems' orders found in the original sheet or in AlgoExpert depending on the folder the file is in.
3. `number2` is the number of correct different solutions I have for that same problem.

## Additional Notes

The point of having more than one solution is that just solving the problem on myself isn't just necessarily the best approach in terms of Time, and Space Comlexity for instance. Therefore, after solving each problem, I should see others' solutions or the solution provided by **AlgoExpert** to that same problem to see how can I solve the same problem more efficiently. In other words, I am practicing not only solving the problem, but also solving it efficiently.

>In some problems there is no **number2** found, and that is mostly because I didn't find a better solution than the first one I submitted.

Moreover, I was practicing in this [Kaggle Notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/bahgat94/problem-solving-level-1) to test my answers in the **Level 1** Folder's problems. However, while practicing **AlgoExpert** problems I tested them on the [AlgoExpert](https://www.algoexpert.io/product)'s platform, and locally.
