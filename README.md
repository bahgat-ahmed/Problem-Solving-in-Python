# Problem-Solving-in-Python
Following Dr. Mostafa Saad's [Algorithmic Interviews Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ClmoHFMqQKOHinRhrId42sbofQ0T0IyaFzZcEcVvXbU/edit#gid=1160016643) for enhancing by problem solving skills. The sheet consists of three levels. I will have a folder for every level inwhich I will insert the problems I solved in that level.

Each file in the folder will be in this format: **problem_name_number1_number2.py**:
1. number1 is the number of the problem in the current level guided by the problems' orders found in the original sheet.
2. number2 is the number of correct different solutions I have for that same problem. 

The point of having more than one solution is that just solving the problem on myself isn't just necessarily the best approach in terms of Time, and Space Comlexity for instance. Therefore, after solving each problem, I should see others' solutions to that same problem to see how can I solve the same problem more efficiently. In other words, I am practicing not only solving the problem, but also solving it efficiently.

>Note:In some problems there is no number2 found, and that is mostly because I didn't find a better solution than the first one I submitted.

Moreover, I was practicing in the following Kaggle Notebook(s) to test my answers: (Will be updated with other Notebooks for levels 2 & 3 when I reach them)
